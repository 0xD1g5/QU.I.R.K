<summary>✅ v3.9–v5.5 (Phases 1–116) — SHIPPED</summary>

All completed milestone roadmaps are archived in `.planning/milestones/`. The next milestone continues from Phase 117.

**v5.5 Distributed Hardening + Stabilization** (Phases 113–116) hardened the v5.4 distributed
scanner into production shape: per-sensor opaque Bearer-token authentication with revocation and a
two-router split (113), automatic merge on full sensor check-in via a failure-isolated FastAPI
BackgroundTask with a config toggle and two trigger conditions (114), a live-UAT stabilization sweep
of the four E2E-surfaced defects — idempotent enroll, importlib.resources cmvp packaging, scheduler
arg fix with target preservation, phantom-row elimination — plus a weak-TLS segment-b lab target so
the per-segment filter is exercisable end-to-end (115), and an evidence-backed Windows packaging
PyInstaller spike returning GO-conditional with a v5.6 effort estimate (116). Audit: 13/13
requirements satisfied, 0 blockers, integration clean. Full details:
`.planning/milestones/v5.5-ROADMAP.md`.

**v5.4 Distributed On-Prem Scanner Architecture** (Phases 106–112) split QU.I.R.K. into a sensor/console
model so a segmented enterprise network is scanned segment-by-segment and merged into one authoritative
CBOM + one quantum-readiness score, with no inbound access to any segment required. Full details:
`.planning/milestones/v5.4-ROADMAP.md`.

## Backlog

Items to be organized into future milestones. Organized by theme.

### Hardware Compatibility & Lifecycle Remediation

Post-v5.5 initiative: make PQC readiness advisory when hardware cannot be upgraded, guide operators toward mitigation (crypto-bridge, replacement timeline, or decommissioning). Scope includes on-prem appliances (F5, Palo Alto, Fortinet, Juniper, HPE iLO, IPMI, Veeam, legacy HSMs) from MVP; cloud load balancers secondary.

- **HWCOMPAT-01** — Hardware fingerprinting layer — detect device type / firmware version from SSH banners, SNMP, HTTP management interfaces
- **HWCOMPAT-02** — Hardware-PQC compatibility matrix — vendor support status, EOL dates, known gaps, CI staleness gate (90-day cadence, similar to model_meta.py)
- **HWCOMPAT-03** — Crypto-bridge detection — identify incompatible endpoints behind compatible gateways (TLS proxy, cloud LB, WAF); classify risk as "mitigated upstream"
- **HWCOMPAT-04** — Remediation roadmap tiers per endpoint — Tier 1 (0–6mo replacement), Tier 2 (6–18mo firmware pending), Tier 3 (18mo+ accept risk), Tier N/A (EOL before PQC relevance)
- **HWCOMPAT-05** — Supply-chain CBOM variants — hardware fingerprint as component (e.g., "F5 BIG-IP v15.1.0 firmware lacks PQC") for procurement visibility
- **HWCOMPAT-06** — Report + operators-guide addendum — surface hardware findings, lifecycle tiers, and bridging strategies

### v5.6 Seeds (from v5.5 close)

- **Full Windows frozen-binary build** — production PyInstaller `--onedir` EXE + Windows Scheduled Task host + installer, gated on the WINPKG-01 spike (GO conditional on the live windows-latest CI build). ~4–5 day estimate.
- **Public-repo cutover + required-status-check enforcement** — make repo public, enforce `windows-sensor-smoke` as a required check, re-run UAT-112-03 item 3.
