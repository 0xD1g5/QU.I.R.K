<summary>✅ v3.9–v5.4 (Phases 1–112) — SHIPPED</summary>

All completed milestone roadmaps are archived in `.planning/milestones/`. The next milestone continues from Phase 113.

**v5.4 Distributed On-Prem Scanner Architecture** (Phases 106–112) split QU.I.R.K. into a sensor/console
model so a segmented enterprise network is scanned segment-by-segment and merged into one authoritative
CBOM + one quantum-readiness score, with no inbound access to any segment required. It locked the wire
contract and forbidden-additions in an architecture doc (106), landed the additive sensor data model
(107), shipped the OS-agnostic `quirk sensor enroll/push/export-results` CLI with a hard-gated
`windows-latest` smoke job (108), the authenticated `POST /api/sensor/push` ingestion endpoint with
dedup/replay/audit (109), Option-A cross-sensor merge with `coverage_warning` and `sensor_id`-keyed CBOM
components (110), console dashboard awareness — sensor registry, per-segment filter, per-segment gauges,
coverage banner (111), and a multi-segment chaos-lab + operators-guide + stabilization close-out (112).

## Next Milestone

The next milestone continues from **Phase 113**. Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to define it (questioning →
research → requirements → roadmap). Carry-forward candidates from v5.4: per-sensor token authentication +
revocation (TD-1), automatic merge-trigger / poll-on-full-check-in (v5.5 per 106 D-06), and the full
Windows packaging ceiling (PyInstaller EXE + Scheduled Task, per 106 D-05).
